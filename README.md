# 🚖 GoodCabs Business Performance Analysis

This project is part of the **Codebasics Resume Challenge #13**, focused on analyzing the business performance of *GoodCabs* — a cab service company operating across Tier-2 Indian cities.  

The goal was to uncover insights related to **passenger behavior, trip trends, and city-wise performance**, using **SQL** for analysis and **Power BI** for dashboarding.

## 📘 Project Overview

The project was divided into two parts:

### 1. Ad-hoc Analysis (SQL)
- Wrote SQL queries to answer **ad-hoc business questions** based on the given data and visualised outputs in Power BI. 
- Organized all queries and results in a structured **Word report**.

### 2. Power BI Dashboard
- Built an **interactive Power BI dashboard** to address the **primary & Secondary business questions**.  
- The dashboard provided insights into overall company performance, city-level KPIs, passenger engagement, and operational efficiency.  
  *(The Power BI file was unfortunately lost, but all the insights, visuals, and learnings are safely documented in the reports and presentation video.)*

## 🧩 Data Model

Here’s the Snowflake data model I built in Power BI — it connects dim_city, dim_date, fact_trips, fact_passenger_summary, and targets tables, along with some additional tables I created where needed.

## 💡 Key Insights & Recommendations

- **Surat** recorded the **highest repeat passenger rate**, while **Mysore** had the lowest — indicating potential loyalty-building opportunities in low-performing cities.  
- **May** showed the **highest repeat rate**, whereas **January** had the lowest — suggesting that promotional campaigns during early months could boost retention.  
- Some cities underperformed against their **target ratings and trip goals**, highlighting the need for **driver training programs** and **city-level marketing**.  
- **Consistent passenger growth** across top cities signals that GoodCabs’ expansion strategy in Tier-2 markets is working effectively.  
- Recommendation: Implement **monthly city performance reviews** using Power BI dashboards to monitor trends and take proactive actions.
