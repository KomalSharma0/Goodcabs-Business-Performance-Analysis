# 🚖 GoodCabs Business Performance Analysis

This project is part of the **Codebasics Resume Challenge #13**, focused on analyzing the business performance of *GoodCabs* — a cab service company operating across Tier-2 Indian cities.  
The goal was to uncover insights related to **passenger behavior, trip trends, and city-wise performance**, using **SQL** for analysis and **Power BI** for dashboarding.

## 📘 Project Overview

The project was divided into two parts:

### 1. Ad-hoc Analysis (SQL)
- Wrote SQL queries to answer **ad-hoc business questions** based on the given data and visualised outputs in Power BI. 
- Organized all queries and results in a structured **Word report**.

### 2. Power BI Dashboard
- Built an **interactive Power BI dashboard** to address the **primary & Secondary business questions**.  
- The dashboard provided insights into overall company performance, city-level KPIs, passenger engagement, and operational efficiency.  
  *(The Power BI file was unfortunately lost, but all the insights, visuals, and learnings are safely documented in the reports and presentation video.)*

## 🧩 Data Model

Here’s the Snowflake data model I built in Power BI — it connects dim_city, dim_date, fact_trips, fact_passenger_summary, and targets tables, along with some additional tables I created where needed.

## Key Insights

- Jaipur and Lucknow recorded the highest trip volumes, establishing them as core demand hubs that require continued focus to maintain market share.  
- Surat showed strong passenger retention but low ratings, signaling a loyal base at risk if service quality doesn’t improve.  
- Mysore and Coimbatore reflected lower demand yet higher fare per km, highlighting potential for niche, premium service offerings.  
- Passenger behavior patterns revealed that tourist cities (Jaipur, Mysore, Kochi) see quicker repeat cycles, while business cities (Lucknow, Coimbatore, Surat) have steadier, long-term usage.  
- While trip volumes remained broadly stable, new passenger growth lagged behind targets and ratings trended downward — pointing to customer experience gaps.

## Recommendations
- Strengthen presence in weaker cities like Surat, Vadodara, and Coimbatore through local partnerships with hotels, malls, and events to attract new riders.  
- Improve ratings in Surat and Lucknow by investing in driver training, better support systems, and in-app feedback loops.  
- Introduce commuter passes for business hubs (Lucknow, Coimbatore, Surat) and seasonal tourist packages for cities like Jaipur, Mysore, and Kochi.  
- Optimize supply by adding more cabs during high-demand months (Feb–May) and scaling down during low-demand months like June.  
- Pilot EV adoption in high-demand markets (Jaipur, Lucknow) to reduce operational costs and enhance brand sustainability.
